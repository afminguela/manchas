# Manchas
webapp related to dirt and how to clean it. (Designed for moms by mom)

Created enterely using Cursor as main AI for coding and perplexity to create and populate database. 

### The main idea

This project is born from the need to have on hand all the traditional stain cleaning remedies that are not transmitted by ours grannies.

The idea was to be able to develop it entirely with generative code AI, but using the technologies that I know to be able to review what it does and how.

### The First Stack

- Html, css and Js in the initial phase for frontend

- Java, springboot and hibernate as backend technologies

- Sql for the database

### The first iteration 

- I want to use Vue.Js and tailwind at frontend.

- develop an independent rest Api with the data base.

- or... include a datasheet inside Java with Hibernate. 

### Next steps
- use Astro components on Frontend
- Docker to deploy
- Deploy on my VPS with a subdomain.
